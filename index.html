        <strong>About the Columbia River and its Faulty Management:</strong>
        <p>The Columbia River Treaty was signed in 1964 by representatives of Canada and the US. It was established separate to the existing International Joint Commission, which is a river basin organization that manages the rest of our transboundary waters, so primarily the Great Lakes. (Cosens, 2016). As the CRT approached the end of its mandated tenure, operating entities began preparing for a negotiation or modernization process. This multi-year process began in 2009 with technical studies, and formal review began in 2010. The US Entity for implementation of the CRT also initiated a “Sovereign Review Team” to engage state and Tribal governments in the process– this engagement, though extensive, was also arguably procedurally limited (Bell, 2015).</p>

<p>As modernization became the dominating rhetoric around this process rather than re-negotiation, water leaders informally shared their opinions that a formal “re-negotiation” was likely avoided due to expected passage hurdles within the US Congress. However, an Agreement in Principle was reached at the end of 2024, prior to the Trump Administration’s current tenure. It famously elevated the desired 3rd leg to the stool, which added ecological concerns to the existing two legs: hydropower generation and flood mitigation.</p>

<p>Though this third leg has been added, it's still not held to the same mandated standards as the other two, nor have they built in mechanisms that adequately increase the institutional capacity of the CRT across the entire basin to implement ecological management effectively. Two new groups were proposed, the Joint Ecological Body or JEB, which will be managed and led by Tribes and First Nations; and the Kootenai Working Group. As noted by Jim Heffernan, a well-established and highly respected policy analyst in the Basin with the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, Tribes have been “fostering a culture of abundant salmon since time immemorial” (Heffernan, n.d.).</p>

<p>Furthermore, scholars have argued that the severe decline in anadromous fish populations (including, but not limited to salmon species) is not only linked to an exclusion of diverse values, but also a refusal to consider “how sociopolitical histories and lifeways underpin stakeholders’ divergent objectives (Cosens, 2016; Ebel & Ortman, 2024). These barriers to ‘good governance’ will likely continue to exacerbate not only fish decline, but also the continued cultural violence experienced by Indigenous peoples- just as Heffernan suggests, the two cannot be separated, and are inherently and intricately intertwined at an ontological level.</p>

<p>The destruction of Celilo Falls, a loss of unimaginable magnitude that continues to reverberate throughout the region, succinctly elucidates the sheer lack of meaningful consideration of Indigenous peoples’ lifeways, and I’d argue intentionally subjugates their legal and rightful sovereignty. Though it stood for over 11,000 years as a sacred site, it only took four hours to be submerged with the construction of the Dalles Dam (Friedenwald-Fishman, 2021). In 1946, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Commission also noted the importance of the site (albeit in economic terms) by recording the volume of fish consumed and sold by Indigenous populations. This included “2.5 million pounds of salmon and steelhead, with a wholesale value of about $375 thousand” (Pinkham, 2007). Reports published prior to the construction of the dam also emphasized the economic benefits to the Tribes in the region, and largely ignored the clause in Tribal fishing rights that included access to their “usual and accustomed places” (Mott, 2024).</p>

<p>Given the systemic exclusion of Indigenous voices, I wanted to create a map that highlights the importance of cultural sites and salmon operations in the basin, while emphasizing the new third leg of the treaty/stool. I will be including this entire sub-section below the map to provide additional context, and to engage in the process of writing and mapping as noted by Kelly et al (2024). Kelly states that “Writing and mapmaking were mutually constitutive and necessary components to addressing the question at hand.” (2024). This inclusion of the review on my map is a small step in that direction.</p>
